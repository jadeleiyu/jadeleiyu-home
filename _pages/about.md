I am an AI research scientist at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/). I study Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Agents, and their interpretability.

In particular, I am interested in the following research directions:
* Building LLM-based AI agents to solve challenging tasks that involve multi-step planning and multimodal reasoning.
* Improving the safety, robustness and trustworthiness of LLMs.
* Understanding and enhancing the reasoning capability of LLMs.


Before joining FAIR, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/index.html) at [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/), under the supervision of [Yang Xu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yangxu/).
